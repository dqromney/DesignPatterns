/**
 * The front controller design pattern is used to provide a centralized request handling mechanism so that all
 * requests will be handled by a single handler. This handler can do the authentication/ authorization/ logging or
 * tracking of request and then pass the requests to corresponding handlers. Following are the entities of this type
 * of design pattern.
 * <p>
 * Front Controller - Single handler for all kinds of requests coming to the application (either web based/ desktop
 * based).
 * <p>
 * Dispatcher - Front Controller may use a dispatcher object which can dispatch the request to corresponding specific
 * handler.
 * <p>
 * View - Views are the object for which the requests are made.
 * <p>
 * Implementation
 * We are going to create a FrontController and Dispatcher to act as Front Controller and Dispatcher correspondingly.
 * HomeView and StudentView represent various views for which requests can come to front controller.
 * <p>
 * FrontControllerPatternDemo, our demo class, will use FrontController to demonstrate Front Controller Design Pattern.
